If such an event occurs, monitor radio, television or online reports to learn about emergency instructions for your area.If you know you've been overexposed to radiation, seek emergency medical care.Radiation is the energy released from atoms as either a wave or a tiny particle of matter.

Don't wait for problems to arise before seeking help.\nIf you have adopted a child or are providing foster care, you may not know if the biological mother drank alcohol while pregnant \u2014 and it may not initially occur to you that your child may have fetal alcohol syndrome. However, if your child has problems with learning and behavior, talk with his or her doctor so that the underlying cause might be identified.\nRequest an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\nCausesWhen you're pregnant and you drink alcohol:\n\nAlcohol enters your bloodstream and reaches your developing fetus by crossing the placenta\nAlcohol causes higher blood alcohol concentrations in your developing baby than in your body because a fetus metabolizes alcohol slower than an adult does\nAlcohol interferes with the delivery of oxygen and optimal nutrition to your developing baby\nExposure to alcohol before birth can harm the development of tissues and organs and cause permanent brain damage in your baby\n\nThe more you drink while pregnant, the greater the risk to your unborn baby. However, any amount of alcohol puts your baby at risk. Your baby's brain, heart and blood vessels begin to develop in the early weeks of pregnancy, before you may know you're pregnant.\nImpairment of facial features, the heart and other organs, including the bones, and the central nervous system may occur as a result of drinking alcohol during the first trimester. That's when these parts of the fetus are in key stages of development. However, the risk is present at any time during pregnancy.\nRisk factorsThe more alcohol you drink during pregnancy, the greater the chance of problems in your baby. There's no known safe amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.\nYou could put your baby at risk even before you realize you're pregnant. Don't drink alcohol if:\n\nYou're pregnant\nYou think you might be pregnant\nYou're trying to become pregnant\n\nComplicationsProblem behaviors not present at birth that can result from having fetal alcohol syndrome (secondary disabilities) may include:\n\nAttention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\nAggression, inappropriate social conduct, and breaking rules and laws\nAlcohol or drug misuse\nMental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety or eating disorders\nProblems staying in or completing school\nProblems with independent living and with employment\nInappropriate sexual behaviors\nEarly death by accident, homicide or suicide\n\nPreventionExperts know that fetal alcohol syndrome is completely preventable if women don't drink alcohol at all during pregnancy.\nThese guidelines can help prevent fetal alcohol syndrome:\n\nDon't drink alcohol if you're trying to get pregnant. If you haven't already stopped drinking, stop as soon as you know you're pregnant or if you even think you might be pregnant. It's never too late to stop drinking during your pregnancy, but the sooner you stop, the better it is for your baby.\nContinue to avoid alcohol throughout your pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome is completely preventable in children whose mothers don't drink during pregnancy.\nConsider giving up alcohol during your childbearing years if you're sexually active and you're having unprotected sex. Many pregnancies are unplanned, and damage can occur in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.\nIf you have an alcohol problem, get help before you get pregnant.

Symptoms range from mild to severe, although many people don't experience symptoms until the chronic stage.\nAcute phase\nThe acute phase of Chagas disease, which lasts for weeks or months, is often symptom-free. When signs and symptoms do occur, they are usually mild and may include:\n\nSwelling at the infection site\nFever\nFatigue\nRash\nBody aches\nEyelid swelling\nHeadache\nLoss of appetite\nNausea, diarrhea or vomiting\nSwollen glands\nEnlargement of your liver or spleen\n\nSigns and symptoms that develop during the acute phase usually go away on their own. If left untreated, the infection persists and, in some cases, advances to the chronic phase.\nChronic phase\nSigns and symptoms of the chronic phase of Chagas disease may occur 10 to 20 years after initial infection, or they may never occur. In severe cases, however, Chagas disease signs and symptoms may include:\n\nIrregular heartbeat\nCongestive heart failure\nSudden cardiac arrest\nDifficulty swallowing due to enlarged esophagus\nAbdominal pain or constipation due to enlarged colon\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your doctor if you live in or have traveled to an area at risk of Chagas disease and you have signs and symptoms of the condition, such as swelling at the infection site, fever, fatigue, body aches, rash and nausea.\nRequest an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\nCausesThe cause of Chagas disease is the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted from an insect known as the triatomine bug. These insects can become infected by T. cruzi when they ingest blood from an animal already infected with the parasite.\nTriatomine bugs live primarily in mud, thatch or adobe huts in Mexico, South America and Central America. They hide in crevices in the walls or roof during the day, then come out at night \u2014 often feeding on sleeping humans.\nInfected bugs defecate after feeding, leaving behind T. cruzi parasites on the skin. The parasites can then enter your body through your eyes, mouth, a cut or scratch, or the wound from the bug's bite.\nScratching or rubbing the bite site helps the parasites enter your body. Once in your body, the parasites multiply and spread.\nYou may also become infected by:\n\nEating uncooked food contaminated with feces from T. cruzi-infected bugs\nBeing born to a woman infected with T. cruzi\nHaving a blood transfusion containing infected blood\nGetting an organ transplant containing viable T. cruzi\nWorking in a laboratory where there's an accidental exposure to the parasite\nSpending time in a forest that contains infected wild animals, such as raccoons and opossums\n\nRisk factorsThe following factors may increase your risk of getting Chagas disease:\n\nLiving in impoverished rural areas of Central America, South America and Mexico\nLiving in a residence that contains triatomine bugs\nReceiving a blood transfusion or organ transplant from a person who carries the infection\n\nIt's rare for travelers to the at-risk areas in South America, Central America and Mexico to contract Chagas disease because travelers tend to stay in well-constructed buildings, such as hotels. Triatomine bugs are usually found in structures built with mud or adobe or thatch.\nComplicationsIf Chagas disease progresses to the chronic phase, serious heart or digestive complications may occur. These may include:\n\nHeart failure. Heart failure occurs when your heart becomes so weak or stiff that it can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs.\nEnlargement of the esophagus (megaesophagus). This rare condition is caused by the abnormal widening (dilation) of your esophagus, which can result in difficulty with swallowing and digestion.\nEnlargement of the colon (megacolon). Megacolon occurs when your colon becomes abnormally dilated, causing abdominal pain, distention and severe constipation.\n\nPreventionIf you live in a high-risk area for Chagas disease, these steps can help you prevent infection:\n\nAvoid sleeping in a mud, thatch or adobe house. These types of residences are more likely to harbor triatomine bugs.\nUse insecticide-soaked netting over your bed when sleeping in thatch, mud or adobe houses.\nUse insecticides to remove insects from your residence.\nUse insect repellent on exposed skin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function () {\r\n        if (window.localStorage.getItem(\"scroll\") == \"scroll\")\r\n        {\r\n            $('html,body').animate({ \r\n                scrollTop: $('#scrollHere').offset().top\r\n            }, 0//increase for smooth, visible scroll\r\n            )\r\n            window.localStorage.setItem(\"scroll\", null);\r\n            $('.articlelist').children('li').first().children('a').first().focus();\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\n\n\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function(){\r\n      var $paginationPrev = $(\".btn\");\r\n      var $scrollHere = $(\"#scrollHere\");\r\n\r\n      $paginationPrev.on(\"click\", function(){\r\n          window.localStorage.setItem(\"scroll\", \"scroll\");\r\n      });\r\n     \r\n    });\r\n\n\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\n", "symptoms_list": []}, "Amnesia": {"text": "", "symptoms_list": ["Difficulty learning new information following the onset of amnesia (anterograde amnesia)", "Difficulty remembering past events and previously familiar information (retrograde amnesia)"]}, "Dissociative disorders": {"text": "", "symptoms_list": ["Memory loss (amnesia) of certain time periods, events, people and personal information", "A sense of being detached from yourself and your emotions", "A perception of the people and things around you as distorted and unreal", "A blurred sense of identity", "Significant stress or problems in your relationships, work or other important areas of your life", "Inability to cope well with emotional or professional stress", "Mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors"]}, "Transient global amnesia": {"text": "Transient global amnesia is identified by its main symptom, which is the inability to form new memories and to recall the recent past.

In fact, many doctors consider cellulite a normal occurrence. If you're concerned about the appearance of your skin, see your doctor, dermatologist or plastic surgeon.Little is known about what causes cellulite. It involves fibrous connective cords that tether the skin to the underlying muscle, with the fat lying between. As fat cells accumulate, they push up against the skin, while the long, tough cords pull down. This creates an uneven surface or dimpling.Cellulite is much more common in women than in men.

Cellulite is also more common with aging, when the skin loses elasticity.Weight gain can make cellulite more noticeable, but some lean people have cellulite, as well.

In response, your pancreas \u2014 a large gland behind your stomach \u2014 produces insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose move from your bloodstream into your body's cells, where it's used as energy.During pregnancy, the placenta, which connects your baby to your blood supply, produces high levels of various other hormones. Almost all of them impair the action of insulin in your cells, raising your blood sugar. Modest elevation of blood sugar after meals is normal during pregnancy.As your baby grows, the placenta produces more and more insulin-counteracting hormones. In gestational diabetes, the placental hormones provoke a rise in blood sugar to a level that can affect the growth and welfare of your baby.

Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder are the most common eating disorders. Other eating disorders include rumination disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa \u2014 often simply called anorexia \u2014 is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted perception of weight or shape. People with anorexia use extreme efforts to control their weight and shape, which often significantly interferes with their health and life activities.When you have anorexia, you excessively limit calories or use other methods to lose weight, such as excessive exercise, using laxatives or diet aids, or vomiting after eating. Efforts to reduce your weight, even when underweight, can cause severe health problems, sometimes to the point of deadly self-starvation.Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa \u2014 commonly called bulimia \u2014 is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. When you have bulimia, you have episodes of bingeing and purging that involve feeling a lack of control over your eating. Many people with bulimia also restrict their eating during the day, which often leads to more binge eating and purging.During these episodes, you typically eat a large amount of food in a short time, and then try to rid yourself of the extra calories in an unhealthy way. Because of guilt, shame and an intense fear of weight gain from overeating, you may force vomiting or you may exercise too much or use other methods, such as laxatives, to get rid of the calories.If you have bulimia, you're probably preoccupied with your weight and body shape, and may judge yourself severely and harshly for your self-perceived flaws. You may be at a normal weight or even a bit overweight.When you have binge-eating disorder, you regularly eat too much food (binge) and feel a lack of control over your eating. You may eat quickly or eat more food than intended, even when you're not hungry, and you may continue eating even long after you're uncomfortably full.After a binge, you may feel guilty, disgusted or ashamed by your behavior and the amount of food eaten. But you don't try to compensate for this behavior with excessive exercise or purging, as someone with bulimia or anorexia might. Embarrassment can lead to eating alone to hide your bingeing.A new round of bingeing usually occurs at least once a week. You may be normal weight, overweight or obese.Rumination disorder is repeatedly and persistently regurgitating food after eating, but it's not due to a medical condition or another eating disorder such as anorexia, bulimia or binge-eating disorder. Food is brought back up into the mouth without nausea or gagging, and regurgitation may not be intentional. Sometimes regurgitated food is rechewed and reswallowed or spit out.The disorder may result in malnutrition if the food is spit out or if the person eats significantly less to prevent the behavior. The occurrence of rumination disorder may be more common in infancy or in people who have an intellectual disability.This disorder is characterized by failing to meet your minimum daily nutrition requirements because you don't have an interest in eating; you avoid food with certain sensory characteristics, such as color, texture, smell or taste; or you're concerned about the consequences of eating, such as fear of choking. Food is not avoided because of fear of gaining weight.The disorder can result in significant weight loss or failure to gain weight in childhood, as well as nutritional deficiencies that can cause health problems.An eating disorder can be difficult to manage or overcome by yourself. Eating disorders can virtually take over your life. If you're experiencing any of these problems, or if you think you may have an eating disorder, seek medical help.Unfortunately, many people with eating disorders may not think they need treatment. If you're worried about a loved one, urge him or her to talk to a doctor. Even if your loved one isn't ready to acknowledge having an issue with food, you can open the door by expressing concern and a desire to listen.", "symptoms_list": ["Skipping meals or making excuses for not eating", "Adopting an overly restrictive vegetarian diet", "Excessive focus on healthy eating", "Making own meals rather than eating what the family eats", "Withdrawing from normal social activities", "Persistent worry or complaining about being fat and talk of losing weight", "Frequent checking in the mirror for perceived flaws", "Repeatedly eating large amounts of sweets or high-fat foods", "Use of dietary supplements, laxatives or herbal products for weight loss", "Excessive exercise", "Calluses on the knuckles from inducing vomiting", "Problems with loss of tooth enamel that may be a sign of repeated vomiting", "Leaving during meals to use the toilet", "Eating much more food in a meal or snack than is considered normal", "Expressing depression, disgust, shame or guilt about eating habits", "Eating in secret"]}, "Ebola virus and Marburg virus": {"text": "", "symptoms_list": ["Fever", "Severe headache", "Joint and muscle aches", "Chills", "Weakness"]}, "Ebstein's anomaly": {"text": "", "symptoms_list": ["Shortness of breath, especially with exertion", "Fatigue", "Heart palpitations or abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)", "A bluish discoloration of the lips and skin caused by low oxygen (cyanosis)"]}, "Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)": {"text": "", "symptoms_list": ["Fluttering", "Pounding or jumping", "Skipped beats or missed beats", "Increased awareness of your heartbeat"]}, "Ectopic pregnancy": {"text": "At first, an ectopic pregnancy might not cause any signs or symptoms.

Testicular torsion must be treated within hours of the beginning of signs and symptoms to save the testicle.A hydrocele can develop before birth. Normally, the testicles descend from the developing baby's abdominal cavity into the scrotum. A sac accompanies each testicle, allowing fluid to surround the testicles. Usually, each sac closes and the fluid is absorbed. Sometimes, the fluid remains after the sac closes (noncommunicating hydrocele). The fluid is usually absorbed gradually within the first year of life. But occasionally, the sac remains open (communicating hydrocele). The sac can change size or if the scrotal sac is compressed, fluid can flow back into the abdomen. Communicating hydroceles are often associated with inguinal hernia.A hydrocele can develop as a result of injury or inflammation within the scrotum. Inflammation might be caused by an infection in the testicle or in the small, coiled tube at the back of each testicle (epididymitis).Most hydroceles are present at birth.

When severe, PID might cause fever, chills, severe lower abdominal or pelvic pain \u2014 especially during a pelvic exam \u2014 and bowel discomfort.\nSee your doctor or seek urgent medical care if you experience:\nIf your signs and symptoms persist but aren't severe, see your doctor as soon as possible. Vaginal discharge with an odor, painful urination or bleeding between menstrual cycles can be associated with a sexually transmitted infection (STI). If these signs and symptoms occur, stop having sex and see your doctor soon. Prompt treatment of an STI can help prevent PID.Many types of bacteria can cause PID, but gonorrhea or chlamydia infections are the most common. These bacteria are usually acquired during unprotected sex.\n\nLess commonly, bacteria can enter your reproductive tract anytime the normal barrier created by the cervix is disturbed. This can happen after childbirth, miscarriage or abortion.\nA number of factors might increase your risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, including:\n\nBeing a sexually active woman younger than 25 years old\n\nHaving multiple sexual partners\n\nBeing in a sexual relationship with a person who has more than one sex partner\n\nHaving sex without a condom\n\nDouching regularly, which upsets the balance of good versus harmful bacteria in the vagina and might mask symptoms\n\nHaving a history of pelvic inflammatory disease or a sexually transmitted infection\n\nMost experts now agree that having an intrauterine device (IUD) inserted does not increase the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. Any potential risk is generally within the first three weeks after insertion.\n\nComplicationsUntreated pelvic inflammatory disease might cause scar tissue. You might also develop collections of infected fluid (abscesses) in your fallopian tubes, which could damage your reproductive organs.\n\nOther complications might include:\n\nEctopic pregnancy. PID is a major cause of tubal (ectopic) pregnancy. In an ectopic pregnancy, the scar tissue from PID prevents the fertilized egg from making its way through the fallopian tube to implant in the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies can cause massive, life-threatening bleeding and require emergency medical attention.\n\nInfertility. PID might damage your reproductive organs and cause infertility \u2014 the inability to become pregnant. The more times you've had PID, the greater your risk of infertility. Delaying treatment for PID also dramatically increases your risk of infertility.\n\nChronic pelvic pain. Pelvic inflammatory disease can cause pelvic pain that might last for months or years. Scarring in your fallopian tubes and other pelvic organs can cause pain during intercourse and ovulation.\n\nTubo-ovarian abscess. PID might cause an abscess \u2014 a collection of pus \u2014 to form in your uterine tube and ovaries. If left untreated, you could develop a life-threatening infection.\n\nPreventionTo reduce your risk of pelvic inflammatory disease:\n\nPractice safe sex. Use condoms every time you have sex, limit your number of partners, and ask about a potential partner's sexual history.\nTalk to your doctor about contraception. Many forms of contraception do not protect against the development of PID. Using barrier methods, such as a condom, might help to reduce your risk. Even if you take birth control pills, it's still important to use a condom every time you have sex to protect against STIs.\nGet tested. If you're at risk of an STI, such as chlamydia, make an appointment with your doctor for testing. Set up a regular screening schedule with your doctor if needed. Early treatment of an STI gives you the best chance of avoiding PID.\nRequest that your partner be tested. If you have pelvic inflammatory disease or an STI, advise your partner to be tested and, if necessary, treated. This can prevent the spread of STIs and possible recurrence of PID.\nDon't douche. Douching upsets the balance of bacteria in your vagina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function () {\r\n        if (window.localStorage.getItem(\"scroll\") == \"scroll\")\r\n        {\r\n            $('html,body').animate({ \r\n                scrollTop: $('#scrollHere').offset().top\r\n            }, 0//increase for smooth, visible scroll\r\n            )\r\n            window.localStorage.setItem(\"scroll\", null);\r\n            $('.articlelist').children('li').first().children('a').first().focus();\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\n\n\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function(){\r\n      var $paginationPrev = $(\".btn\");\r\n      var $scrollHere = $(\"#scrollHere\");\r\n\r\n      $paginationPrev.on(\"click\", function(){\r\n          window.localStorage.setItem(\"scroll\", \"scroll\");\r\n      });\r\n     \r\n    });\r\n\n\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\n", "symptoms_list": []}, "Small bowel prolapse (enterocele)": {"text": "", "symptoms_list": ["A pulling sensation in your pelvis that eases when you lie down", "A feeling of pelvic fullness, pressure or pain", "Low back pain that eases when you lie down", "A soft bulge of tissue in your vagina", "Vaginal discomfort and painful intercourse (dyspareunia)"]}, "Uterine prolapse": {"text": "", "symptoms_list": ["Sensation of heaviness or pulling in your pelvis", "Tissue protruding from your vagina", "Urinary problems, such as urine leakage (incontinence) or urine retention", "Trouble having a bowel movement", "Feeling as if you're sitting on a small ball or as if something is falling out of your vagina", "Sexual concerns, such as a sensation of looseness in the tone of your vaginal tissue"]}, "Pemphigus": {"text": "Pemphigus is characterized by blisters on your skin and mucous membranes.

Keep in mind, however, that some women who have postpartum thyroiditis develop symptoms of only hyperthyroidism or only hypothyroidism, but not both. The exact cause of postpartum thyroiditis isn't clear. However, women who develop postpartum thyroiditis often have high concentrations of anti-thyroid antibodies in early pregnancy and after childbirth. As a result, it's believed that women who develop postpartum thyroiditis likely have an underlying autoimmune thyroid condition that flares after childbirth due to fluctuations in immune function. This underlying condition appears to be very similar to Hashimoto's disease, in which your immune system attacks your thyroid gland. You might be at increased risk of postpartum thyroiditis if you have: While further research is needed, some studies have also shown a link between postpartum thyroiditis and postpartum depression. As a result, if you have postpartum depression your doctor will likely check to see how your thyroid is functioning. For most women who develop postpartum thyroiditis, thyroid function eventually returns to normal \u2014 typically within 12 to 18 months of the start of symptoms. However, some women who experience postpartum thyroiditis don't recover from the hypothyroid phase. As a result, they develop hypothyroidism, a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain important hormones.
